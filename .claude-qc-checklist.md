# Claude Code Quality Checklist

**MANDATORY - Run BEFORE every commit**

## 1. Component Integration Check
- [ ] Does the page use `<Layout>` component? (Check: `grep -r "import Layout" src/pages/`)
- [ ] Are all imports from existing components? (No missing files)
- [ ] Does the component match the site's structure? (Check similar pages)

## 2. Local Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No missing imports
- [ ] Check bundle sizes are reasonable

## 3. Local Preview Test
```bash
npm run preview
# Visit http://localhost:4173/[your-route]
```
- [ ] Page loads without white screen
- [ ] Site navigation appears (header)
- [ ] Site footer appears
- [ ] Content is readable (not white text on white background)
- [ ] No console errors in browser devtools

## 4. Component Prop Validation
- [ ] All required props are provided
- [ ] Components handle invalid/undefined props gracefully
- [ ] Add guards for config lookups: `if (!config) return null;`

## 5. Route Verification
```bash
grep -n "path:" src/routes/contentRoutes.tsx | grep [your-route]
```
- [ ] Route is registered in routes file
- [ ] Path matches expected URL
- [ ] Component is lazy-loaded correctly

## 6. Style Integration
- [ ] Custom styles don't override site styles
- [ ] Colors use CSS variables where possible
- [ ] Responsive design tested (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## 7. Pre-Deploy Checklist
- [ ] Run full build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Check git status: `git status`
- [ ] Review all changed files
- [ ] Test locally: `npm run preview`
- [ ] Verify routes work in preview

## NEVER SKIP THESE STEPS

**If any check fails, FIX IT before committing.**

**If unsure, ask the user for feedback on local testing.**
