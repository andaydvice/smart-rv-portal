        <p>The system constantly monitors how much power each appliance uses and shows this on your dashboard in simple terms â€“ like "Coffee Maker: 900 watts for 5 minutes."</p>
        <p>When multiple appliances run at once, the system prevents blown fuses by managing which ones can operate together.</p>
        <p>You'll receive clear notifications like "AC and Microwave cannot run together on 30-amp service" to prevent power issues.</p>
        <p>The battery monitor shows your power level just like a fuel gauge, making it easy to know when to recharge.</p>
