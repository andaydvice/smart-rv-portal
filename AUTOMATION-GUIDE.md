# 🤖 Automated Quality Control & Deployment

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete

This project now has **automatic quality control** that prevents broken deployments and catches errors before they reach production.

---

## 🛡️ What's Automated

### 1. **Pre-Commit Quality Control** ✅

**Every time you commit, automatically:**
- ✅ Verifies all SEO changes (breadcrumbs, schemas, links)
- ✅ Runs build test to catch TypeScript/compile errors
- ❌ **Blocks commit** if anything fails

**Location:** `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

**How it works:**
```bash
git commit -m "Add feature"
  ↓
🤖 Auto-runs: verify-seo-changes.sh
🤖 Auto-runs: npm run build
  ↓
✅ All pass → Commit proceeds
❌ Any fail → Commit blocked, shows errors
```

### 2. **Post-Deployment Verification** ✅

**After deploying to production, automatically:**
- ✅ Checks if site is reachable (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Verifies React app loads
- ✅ Checks critical assets exist
- ✅ Tests feature pages for expected content
- ⚠️ **Alerts if deployment is broken**

**Location:** `post-deploy-verify.sh`

**How to run manually:**
```bash
./post-deploy-verify.sh
```

### 3. **Automatic Rollback System** ✅

**If post-deploy verification fails:**
- 🚨 Detects broken deployment
- 📋 Shows what failed
- 🔄 Provides rollback instructions
- 💾 Auto-rollback (if netlify-cli installed)

**How to enable auto-rollback:**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
```

### 4. **GitHub Actions Integration** ✅

**Automatically runs after every push to main:**
- Waits for Netlify deployment
- Runs post-deploy verification
- Fails the workflow if site is broken
- Shows errors in GitHub Actions tab

**Location:** `.github/workflows/post-deploy-verify.yml`

## 📋 Usage Guide

### For Developers (Claude Code)

**Before making changes:**
```bash
# Changes are made automatically with QC verification built-in
# No manual steps needed
```

**When committing:**
```bash
git commit -m "Your message"
# Pre-commit hook runs automatically
# Commit proceeds only if all checks pass
```

### For Project Owner

**You do nothing!** Everything is automatic:

1. ✅ Claude makes changes
2. ✅ QC Agent verifies changes
3. ✅ Pre-commit hook tests build
4. ✅ Commit only if all checks pass
5. ✅ Push to GitHub
6. ✅ Netlify deploys
7. ✅ Post-deploy verification runs
8. ✅ Alerts if anything is broken

**If something breaks:**
- GitHub Actions will show red ❌
- Post-deploy verification log shows what failed
- Rollback instructions provided automatically

## 🔧 Manual Commands

### Test SEO Changes Locally
```bash
./verify-seo-changes.sh
```

### Test Build Locally
```bash
npm run build
```

### Verify Live Deployment
```bash
./post-deploy-verify.sh
```

### Manual Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Via Netlify dashboard
# 1. Go to Deploys tab
# 2. Find last working deploy
# 3. Click "Publish deploy"

# Or via CLI
netlify rollback
```

## 📊 What Each Check Does

### Pre-Commit Checks

| Check | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| SEO Verification | Confirms breadcrumbs, schemas, links exist in code | Prevents claiming work that wasn't done |
| Build Test | Runs `npm run build` | Catches TypeScript errors, missing imports, syntax errors |

### Post-Deploy Checks

| Check | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Site Reachability | Checks HTTP 200 response | Detects if site is down |
| React App | Verifies root element exists | Catches broken React builds |
| Asset Bundles | Checks for JS/CSS files | Detects missing build artifacts |
| Feature Pages | Tests sample pages load | Ensures routes work |

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

Coming soon:
- ✅ Performance monitoring (bundle size, load time)
- ✅ Link health checks (detect 404s)
- ✅ Automatic PR creation
- ✅ Schema.org validation
- ✅ Image optimization checks

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit hook not running?
```bash
# Make sure it's executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Verify it exists
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Want to skip pre-commit checks? (Not recommended)
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```

### Post-deploy verification failing?
```bash
# Check what's wrong
./post-deploy-verify.sh

# View detailed curl output
curl -v https://smartrvhub.com
```

## 📝 Notes

- Pre-commit hooks are **local only** (not in git repo)
- Each developer needs to run setup after cloning
- GitHub Actions runs for everyone automatically
- Netlify CLI required for auto-rollback

---

## ✅ Verification

**To verify automation is working:**

1. Make a small change to any file
2. Try to commit
3. Watch pre-commit checks run
4. If they pass, commit succeeds
5. Push to main
6. Check GitHub Actions tab
7. See post-deploy verification run

**All automated. No manual intervention needed.**
