# Example: What the Todo List SHOULD Have Been

**Before touching any code, create this comprehensive plan:**

## Phase 1: Audit (15 minutes)
- [ ] Find ALL image files in public/ directory
- [ ] Find ALL image references in src/ code
- [ ] Find ALL image references in public/ HTML files
- [ ] Categorize by location (src/assets vs public/)
- [ ] Verify which files need conversion vs code-only changes
- [ ] Document expected before/after state

## Phase 2: Conversion (10 minutes)
- [ ] Convert public/lovable-uploads/*.{jpg,png,jpeg} to .webp
- [ ] Convert public/*.{jpg,png,jpeg} to .webp
- [ ] Verify all WebP files created successfully
- [ ] Check file sizes (should be smaller)

## Phase 3: Update References (5 minutes)
- [ ] Update all references in src/ to public/ images → .webp
- [ ] Update all references in public/*.html → .webp
- [ ] DO NOT touch src/assets imports (files not converted)
- [ ] Verify with grep - no .jpg/.png refs to public/ images

## Phase 4: Verification (10 minutes)
- [ ] Run npm run build locally
- [ ] Verify build succeeds with no errors
- [ ] Check dist/ folder for correct images
- [ ] Visual check of 5-10 key pages
- [ ] Run comprehensive grep for missed references

## Phase 5: Cleanup (5 minutes)
- [ ] Delete old .jpg/.png files from public/
- [ ] Commit changes with clear message
- [ ] Push to feature branch
- [ ] Create PR with verification checklist

## Total Estimated Time: 45 minutes
## Actual Time if Followed: 45 minutes
## Actual Time Without Plan: 3 hours 50 minutes

## The Irony

I wrote a document saying "30 minutes of planning saves hours" but:
- ❌ Didn't create a todo list before starting
- ❌ Didn't break down the task into steps
- ❌ Didn't verify each step before moving to the next
- ❌ Made assumptions instead of checking
- ❌ Fixed errors one-by-one instead of comprehensive audit

**If I had used TodoWrite and followed this plan, NONE of the disasters would have happened.**
