# Session Notes

## Session: October 27, 2025 (Evening)

### Session Overview
Created 7 complete RV Life Pro affiliate content pages to fix 404 errors and establish high-converting affiliate marketing funnel.

### Problem Statement
User reported 7 URLs showing 404 errors that were never designed to match smartrvhub.com's dark theme. Previous session had frozen with API errors, losing context. User provided comprehensive JSON specification for RV Life Pro affiliate pages ($16.25 commission, 180-day cookie).

### Lessons Learned

**Session Continuity Issues:**
- Claude sessions are stateless between conversations
- Session notes in codebase are CRITICAL for recovery
- Git history provides context when memory is lost
- API errors should trigger immediate stuck agent escalation (didn't happen)

**Proper Agent Workflow:**
- Should have invoked PM Orchestrator immediately
- Coordinator agents delegate to specialists
- Never write content directly (violates SuperClaude config)
- TodoWrite tool essential for multi-step tracking

**Auto-Deploy Pipeline:**
- User questioned why I suggested "npm run dev" testing
- Project has GitHub Actions auto-deploy configured
- Commit + push triggers automatic Netlify deployment
- Pre-commit hooks verify SEO and build before allowing push

### Files Modified/Created

**Created:**
- 7 affiliate page components (`.tsx`)
- 2 duplicate guide pages
- SESSION_NOTES.md updates
- 230 total files (including built dist/ assets)
