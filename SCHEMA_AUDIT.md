## 🔴 CRITICAL - Feature Pages with Verified Statistics (Missing Schema)

These pages have 100+ verified statistics each and were specifically optimized for LLM citations. They MUST have Article/HowTo schema to maximize citation potential.

| Page | Current Schema | Should Have | Priority | Reason |
|------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **SmartAutomation.tsx** | ❌ None | ✅ Article + FAQ | 🔴 CRITICAL | 75+ verified stats, energy savings table, market data. Page 3 of LLM SEO implementation. |
| **ClimateControl.tsx** | ❌ None | ✅ Article + HowTo | 🔴 CRITICAL | 60+ verified stats, AC power consumption data, BTU comparison. Phase 5 content. |
| **InternetConnectivity.tsx** | ❌ None | ✅ Article | 🔴 CRITICAL | 50+ verified stats, Starlink data, WiFi booster specs. Phase 5 content. |

**Impact:** These 3 pages contain 185+ verified statistics but have ZERO schema markup, severely limiting their citation potential by AI models.
