# 🚀 Phase 2 Automation - Complete Quality Control

## What's New in Phase 2

Phase 2 adds comprehensive automated quality checks to catch issues before they reach production.

---

## ✅ New Automation Features

### 1. **Auto-Deployment** (GitHub Actions)
- Creates PR automatically when you push to feature branch
- Auto-merges if all checks pass
- No more manual git commands needed
- Triggers Netlify deployment automatically

**Location:** `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`

### 2. **Performance Monitoring**
Automatically checks before every commit:
- Bundle size (warns if > 10MB, fails if > 20MB)
- Large images (flags images > 500KB)
- Dependency bloat (suggests lighter alternatives)
- Main JavaScript bundle size

**Run manually:**
```bash
./performance-check.sh
```

### 3. **Link Health Checker**
Scans codebase for:
- Broken internal links
- Missing money page links in blog posts
- Invalid routes

**Run manually:**
```bash
./link-health-check.sh
```

### 4. **SEO Schema Validator**
Validates:
- Product schema on feature pages
- FAQ schema structure
- Breadcrumb components
- Meta tags and Helmet implementation
- All schema.org types

**Run manually:**
```bash
./schema-validator.sh
```

## 🔄 Enhanced Pre-Commit Workflow

**Every commit now runs 5 automated checks:**

```
git commit -m "Your message"
  ↓
1. SEO Verification ✅
  ↓
2. Build Test ✅
  ↓
3. Performance Monitoring ✅
  ↓
4. Link Health Check ⚠️ (warns only)
  ↓
5. Schema Validation ⚠️ (warns only)
  ↓
All pass → Commit proceeds
Any fail → Commit blocked
```

**Critical checks (block commit):**
- SEO verification
- Build test
- Performance (if bundle > 20MB)

**Warning checks (don't block commit):**
- Link health
- Schema validation

---

## 📋 Installation

### First Time Setup

```bash
cd /Users/user/smart-rv-portal
./setup-hooks.sh
```

This installs the enhanced pre-commit hook with all Phase 2 checks.

### After Pulling Updates

If someone updates the automation scripts:

```bash
git pull
./setup-hooks.sh  # Re-install hook with latest version
```

---

## 🎯 Auto-Deployment Workflow

**What happens when you push code:**

```
Push to claude/* branch
  ↓
GitHub Actions triggered
  ↓
1. Install dependencies
2. Run QC checks
3. Run build test
4. Check performance
  ↓
All pass?
  ↓
Yes → Create PR automatically
  ↓
Auto-merge enabled
  ↓
PR merges to main
  ↓
Netlify deploys
  ↓
Post-deploy verification runs
  ↓
Site live! ✅
```

**You do nothing!** Everything is automatic.

## 📊 Manual Testing

### Test All Checks at Once

```bash
# SEO verification
./verify-seo-changes.sh

# Performance check
npm run build
./performance-check.sh

# Link health
./link-health-check.sh

# Schema validation
./schema-validator.sh

# Post-deployment (after deploy)
./post-deploy-verify.sh
```

### Test Individual Features

```bash
# Just performance
./performance-check.sh

# Just links
./link-health-check.sh

# Just schemas
./schema-validator.sh
```

---

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Performance Thresholds

Edit `performance-check.sh` to adjust:

```bash
# Warning threshold (currently 10MB)
if [ $TOTAL_BYTES -gt 10485760 ]; then

# Critical threshold (currently 20MB)
if [ $TOTAL_BYTES -gt 20971520 ]; then
```

### Link Validation

Edit `link-health-check.sh` to add new valid routes:

```bash
VALID_ROUTES=(
  "/"
  "/pricing"
  # Add your new routes here
)
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit checks are slow

The checks run in sequence. Expected times:
- SEO verification: ~2s
- Build test: ~30-60s (longest)
- Performance: ~5s
- Link health: ~3s
- Schema validation: ~2s

**Total: ~40-75 seconds**

### Want to skip checks temporarily?

```bash
# Not recommended, but possible for emergencies
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```

### Bundle size warnings

If you get performance warnings:

1. Check what's large:
   ```bash
   ./performance-check.sh
   ```

2. Common fixes:
   - Use dynamic imports for large components
   - Lazy load routes
   - Optimize images
   - Remove unused dependencies

### Link health warnings

If links are flagged as broken:

1. Verify the route actually exists in your app
2. Add it to `VALID_ROUTES` in `link-health-check.sh`
3. Or fix the broken link in your code

---

## 📈 Performance Recommendations

**Bundle Size:**
- Target: < 5MB
- Warning: > 10MB
- Critical: > 20MB

**Images:**
- Optimize images > 500KB
- Use WebP format when possible
- Use responsive images

**Dependencies:**
- Avoid heavy libraries (moment.js, lodash)
- Use tree-shaking
- Import only what you need

## 📝 Logs

All checks create temporary logs:

```bash
/tmp/seo-check.log          # SEO verification
/tmp/build-test.log         # Build output
/tmp/perf-check.log         # Performance check
/tmp/link-check.log         # Link health
/tmp/schema-check.log       # Schema validation
```

View them if you need more details:

```bash
cat /tmp/build-test.log
cat /tmp/perf-check.log
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Commit will proceed if:**
- SEO verification passes
- Build succeeds
- Performance within limits

**Warnings won't block commit:**
- Link health issues
- Schema validation warnings
- Image optimization suggestions

---

## 🔄 Updating Automation

When automation scripts are updated:

```bash
git pull origin main
./setup-hooks.sh  # Reinstall hook
```

The hook itself isn't version controlled (it's in `.git/hooks/`), so you need to reinstall it after updates.

---

**Phase 2 automation complete!** Everything runs automatically now.
