# LLM SEO Audit - Smart RV Portal
**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Auditor:** Claude (AI Assistant)
**Focus:** Optimization for AI citations (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Score: 6.2/10**

The Smart RV Portal has solid foundational SEO but **critical gaps in LLM-specific optimization** that limit citation-worthiness. The site has good schema markup infrastructure but underutilizes it. Content lacks the factual density, source attribution, and expertise signals that LLMs prioritize for citations.

### Critical Issues:
1. ❌ **No source citations or data attribution** across all content
2. ❌ **No author bylines or expertise credentials** displayed
3. ⚠️ **FAQ schema defined but not implemented** on FAQ components
4. ⚠️ **Minimal statistics, research, or quantifiable claims**
5. ⚠️ **Generic content lacking unique insights or original data**

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Citation-Worthy Content: **3/10** ❌

**Current State:**
- Content is primarily promotional and descriptive
- No statistics, studies, or data points cited
- No original research or unique insights
- No expert quotes or attributions
- Claims are vague (e.g., "optimizes energy usage" without specifics)

**Examples of Missing Citations:**
```typescript
// src/pages/features/PowerManagement.tsx:74-87
"Our intelligent power management system optimizes energy usage."
// ❌ No data on HOW MUCH optimization (e.g., "reduces energy consumption by 30%")
// ❌ No source for claims
// ❌ No comparison data
```

**Recommendations:**
✅ Add specific statistics: "Solar integration can reduce generator runtime by 40-60% (Source: RV Industry Association 2024)"
✅ Include data points: "Average battery life extended from 3.2 to 5.7 years with smart management"
✅ Cite industry studies and reports
✅ Add original case studies with real numbers
✅ Create data-driven comparison tables

**Priority: CRITICAL** 🔴

---

### 2. Structured Data (Schema): **6/10** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- ✅ Good schema definitions in `src/components/seo/schemas.ts`
- ✅ Organization, Website, Article, Product schemas defined
- ✅ FAQPage schema defined (line 108-119)
- ✅ HowTo schema defined (line 121-141)
- ❌ **FAQ schema NOT implemented** on actual FAQ components

- ⚠️ No VideoObject or ImageObject schemas

**Missing Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/components/technology/TechnologyFAQ.tsx:1-59

// Should include:
import { faqSchema } from '@/components/seo/schemas';

const schemaData = faqSchema(faqs.map(faq => ({
  question: faq.question,
  answer: faq.answer
})));
```

**Recommendations:**
✅ **IMMEDIATE:** Add FAQ schema to TechnologyFAQ.tsx
✅ Add FAQ schema to About page (line 28-41 has data but needs proper implementation)
✅ Implement HowTo schema for guides and tutorials
✅ Add Product schema to all feature pages with pricing
✅ Add BreadcrumbList schema site-wide

## Final Recommendations

The Smart RV Portal has excellent potential for LLM citations but **requires significant content upgrades**. The infrastructure (schema definitions, site structure) is solid, but the content lacks the factual density, source attribution, and expertise signals that make content citation-worthy.

**Focus on these three pillars:**
1. **Facts & Sources:** Every claim needs attribution
2. **Expertise Signals:** Show who and why you're trustworthy
3. **Comprehensive Depth:** Answer questions completely with data

With these improvements, the site could become a primary source for AI models when answering RV technology questions.
