        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-3">
          {question}
        </h2>
      )}

      <p className="text-white text-lg mb-4">
        {answer}
      </p>

      {keyPoints && keyPoints.length > 0 && (
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p className="text-blue-300 font-medium">Key Points:</p>
          <ul className="space-y-1">
