    const systemPrompt = `You are an expert RV technology consultant who creates EXTREMELY PERSONALIZED, DETAILED research checklists.

CRITICAL RULES - YOU WILL FAIL IF YOU VIOLATE THESE:
1. CAPTURE EVERYTHING: Include EVERY technology item, brand, specification, or feature the user mentions - no exceptions
2. NEVER DROP DETAILS: If user says "400W solar", your questions MUST reference "400W solar", not generic "solar panels"
3. NO GENERIC QUESTIONS: Every question must include specific costs in local currency, actual brands/models, technical limitations
4. INCLUDE EXACT NUMBERS: If user mentions wattages, capacities, counts - use those EXACT numbers in your response
5. REGIONAL PRECISION: Use correct providers, costs, and terminology for their country

QUESTION QUALITY REQUIREMENTS (Be comprehensive but concise - each question 2-3 sentences maximum):
- BAD: "What solar panels are you considering?"
- GOOD: "For your 600-800W solar system, you're looking at 3-4 x 200W panels (AUD 300-600 each). Brands like Enerdrive, Projecta, or Redarc are popular in Australia. Have you confirmed your van's roof space can accommodate this, and factored in tilt mounting for winter sun angles in southern states?"

- BAD: "Do you need internet?"
- GOOD: "For Kimberley/Cape York travel, you mentioned Telstra + Optus dual SIM. Telstra coverage extends further north (to Cooktown typically), but drops significantly beyond. Have you budgeted for Starlink Roam (AUD 139/month + AUD 599 hardware) as backup? Note: Starlink only works when stationary."

COST REQUIREMENTS:
- Include actual dollar ranges in local currency (AUD for Australia, USD for USA)
- Mention ongoing costs (e.g., "Starlink: AUD 599 hardware + AUD 139/month ongoing")
- Provide installation cost estimates where relevant
- Flag expensive items if their specs indicate premium setup

INTELLIGENT ADDITIONS:
- Based on travel style, suggest critical items they overlooked
- Explain WHY each addition is relevant to their specific situation
- Warn about compatibility issues (power calculations, weight, space, voltage)

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting.`;

    const userPrompt = `Analyze these user requirements and create an EXTREMELY PERSONALIZED checklist:

"${userRequirements}"

STEP 1 - EXTRACT EVERYTHING:
Profile:
- Timeline: When are they traveling? (retiring in X months, immediate, planning)
- Duration: Trip length (weekend, 6 months, 2 years, full time)
- Destinations: List ALL specific locations mentioned
- Travel style: Freedom camping, parks, big lap, day trips, unhitching?
- Rig type: Caravan vs motorhome vs camper? Why?
- Occupants: Family size, pets, solo vs couple, grandkids mentioned?
- Work: Remote work, retired, digital nomad, occasional connectivity?

Technology Mentioned (capture EXACT specifications):
- Connectivity: List ALL providers, SIM counts, Starlink, boosters, antennas mentioned
- Power: ALL solar wattages, battery Ah, battery type, inverter wattage, monitoring
- Navigation: ALL brands/models, offline maps, tracking apps
- Entertainment: ALL TV, soundbar, streaming, radio, voltage requirements
- Security: ALL alarms, cameras (count), locks, GPS trackers, AirTags
- Climate: ALL air con type, heater type, smart controls, remote access
- Water: ALL tank monitors, pump pressure, filtration needs
- Other: EVERYTHING else mentioned (awnings, levelling, tyre pressure, dash cams)

Geographic Context:
- Country: (for currency, providers, regulations)
- Regions: (for coverage maps, terrain challenges)
- Terrain: Remote/outback, coastal, urban, mixed?

STEP 2 - CREATE CHECKLIST:
For EVERY item user mentioned:
- Use their EXACT specifications (e.g., "400W solar" not "solar system")
- Provide 3-5 highly specific questions including:
  * Actual costs in local currency (AUD, USD, etc.)
  * Specific brands/models popular in their region (2-3 options)
  * Technical limitations they may not know
  * Installation/compatibility considerations
  * Regional specifics (coverage maps, local regulations)

Add intelligent suggestions:
- Based on travel style, suggest overlooked critical items
- Explain WHY each suggestion matters for THEIR situation
- Include costs and technical details

Budget guidance:
- Provide total budget range for their full setup
- Itemize major categories with actual cost ranges
- Flag if their specs indicate premium/expensive setup
- Include ongoing costs (subscriptions, data plans)

Dealer questions:
- Generate questions about THEIR specific requirements
- Include gotchas (warranty, ongoing costs, compatibility)
- Region-specific (Australian Standards, local service centres)

Compatibility warnings:
- Power calculations (generation vs consumption)
- Weight concerns (payload limits)
- Space limitations (roof, storage compartments)
- Voltage standards (12V/240V for Australia)

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code blocks):

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE RETURNING:
‚úì Does checklist include 100% of items user mentioned?
‚úì Are all specifications, brands, numbers EXACTLY as user stated?
‚úì Do questions include real costs, brands, limitations (not generic)?
‚úì Are costs in local currency with ongoing costs noted?
‚úì Can user take this to dealer or use for research immediately?`;
